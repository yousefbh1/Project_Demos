# Instagram Clone
_Built using: python, SQL, React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS_
_Deployed on AWS_

An instagram clone I worked on, using both server-side (Python/SQL backend) and client-side (JS and React) features.
The program utilizes server-side API calls to the database in order to retrieve relevant information, and client-side rendering to display the information well.

A user can create/edit/delete their account information, create a post with a caption, comment, like posts, and follow/unfollow any user.

Please watch the video for a demonstration of these features.
