# Instagram Clone
_Built using: python, SQL, React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS_
_Deployed on AWS_

An instagram clone I worked on, using both server-side (Python/SQL backend) and client-side (JS and React) features.

A user can create/edit/delete their account information, create a post with a caption, comment, like posts, and follow/unfollow any user.

Please watch the video for a demonstration of these features.

_Please note that the source code is kept private, but can be shared if request_
