# Search Engine
_Built using: python, SQL, React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS_
_Deployed on AWS_

An search engine I worked on, using both server-side (Python/SQL backend) and client-side (JS and React) features.
The program utilizes a map-reduce pipeline to efficiently index gigabytes worth of information using tf-idf text analysis, and return a result in less than a second.

A user can adjust the degree of PageRank weight in order to bias link analysis more or less heavily.

Please watch the video for a demonstration of these features.
